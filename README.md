# Math-Function-Simulation
In this repository will be a project that will simulate mathematical functions like Matlab, but with an interface where need to write a function and the program automatically represents the graphic.


UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!

I added the trigonometry and changed the symbols for the power and rooting. 

If you checked my project and liked it or have some advice. Write to my email: nizami_kuliyev@hotmail.com
