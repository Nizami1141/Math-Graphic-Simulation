# Math Function Simulation

This repository contains a project that simulates mathematical functions similar to MATLAB. The application features an intuitive interface where users can input a function, and the program automatically generates the corresponding graph.

## Features

- **Function Input**: Easily input mathematical functions using a user-friendly interface.
- **Graphical Representation**: The program automatically plots the function on a graph for visual analysis.
- **Trigonometric Functions**: Support for trigonometric functions has been added to enhance functionality.
- **Updated Symbols**: Updated symbols for exponentiation and root calculations for better user experience.

## How to Use

1. **Input Function**: Type your mathematical function into the designated input field.
2. **View Graph**: The program will automatically generate and display the graph based on the input function.
